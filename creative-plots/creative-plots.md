# Creative Plots

The plot world is a communal build space where everybody can get dedicated plots of land to build freely in creative, solo or with friends! Equip with intuitive plot controls and [WorldEdit](../general/misc./worldedit.md) with a 500,000 blocks per operation limit, the plot world is a great place to let your creativity shine. The modes flexibility also makes it an ideal place to prototype builds and designs before making them in the survival world.

Use **`/creative`** to travel to the plot world!

### Plot manage menu

Plot settings, access management, and other changes can be made through the plot manage menu accessed by right-clicking the diamond in your hotbar. Plot manage actions are executed on the plot you are currently within.
