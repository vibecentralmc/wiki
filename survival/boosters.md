# Boosters

Boosters are a diverse range of temporary quality of life enhancements and perks that you can activate at any time in [survival](broken-reference) with **Ⓑ** Boost Points

All boosters are available in both a base tier and an upgraded tier, which offers longer lasting and or stronger perks over the base tier. Though the upgraded tier requires a higher number of Ⓑ Boost Points, it offers a better deal and is better value than purchasing the base tier multiple times for the same benefits.

Boosters can be viewed and purchased through the Booster menu using the `/boost` command

### Acquiring Boost Points

**Ⓑ** Boost points can be purchased in the boosters menu for 85 vibecoin and 8 XP levels each.  Boost points are non-tradeable, and unspent boost points will be lost at the end of the [smp season](smp-survival-s8/season-information.md).
