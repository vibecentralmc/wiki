# Market

The market is a massive community ran shopping district where players can build their own shops and buy or sell items for [vibecoin](economy.md), the in-game currency.\
\
The space is is divided into zones that expand with demand, always with terraformed land and paths ready. You can be warped to a random zone by using **`/warp market`**, but if you want to go to a specific zone, just add the number at the end: ex. **`/warp market3`**. Players can additionally create [community waypoints ](tweak-list/community-waypoints.md)at their shops for easy access.

The market is also home to the [Server Sell Shop](server-sell-shop.md), right by **`/warp market1`**&#x20;
