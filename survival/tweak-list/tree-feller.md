# Tree feller

When cutting a tree using an axe tree feller will be activated, making the entire tree fall. Durability loss for each log broken will apply to your item (unbreaking is taken into account). If your axe does not have enough durability to cut down the whole tree, has too little leaves, or you're crouching, tree feller will not activate.
