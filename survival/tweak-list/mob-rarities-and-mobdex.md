# Mob rarities and mobdex

The mobdex is a collection of all the mob rarities you've discovered. You can discover mobs and add them to your mobdex by standing nearby them, right clicking them, or killing them. Rarer mobs are stronger and drop more xp. Note that once a mob is found by a player and added to their mobdex, the same mob can't be discovered again and added to other players mobdexes -- they will have to find another mob of the same rarity that hasn't been discovered by any players yet. Can you collect them all?

When opened, the mobdex displays your collection progress in % at the top, as well as every mob's head. When hovering over a mob head you can see which rarities of this mob you have discovered so far. Mobs that haven't been discovered are replaced by a black cube with a grey "?" and have the name greyed out when hovering over them.

Naturally spawned mobs can appear in 5 different rarities with a set chance:
- Common:    73.6%
- Uncommon:  18.0%
- Rare:      8.0%
- Mythical:  0.5%
- Legendary: 0.1%
