# Biome titles

As you navigate the world and enter new biomes, you will see a subtle title showing the name of the biome you've entered. This is especially helpful with our custom world generation with Terralith, as it adds MANY new biomes.\
\
After a specific biome title is shown, it will be put on a cooldown, but if you enter a new biome you haven't recently had a title for, it will be displayed. Biome titles do not show within the smp spawn or market zones.

You can toggle biome titles on or off any time using the **`/tbt`** (toggle biome title) command.
