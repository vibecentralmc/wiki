# Auction House

The auction house is a menu used to sell miscellaneous items to other players, any time without needing to set up a shop in the market. Unpurchased items listed more than 15 days will be unlisted and returned to the lister through the collection bin.

**Bundles**\
As a courtesy to chat & buyers, we ask that you bundle similar or large quantities of items. Bundle contents can be viewed by right clicking their chest in the menu.
