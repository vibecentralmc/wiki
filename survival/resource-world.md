# Resource World

The resource world is a dedicated for gathering fresh resources to your hearts content, intended to help preserve the main smp world and keep it tidy. Some [quests](questing.md) are resource world specific, and offer extra rewards.

Use **`/warp resource`** to return to your last location in the resource world (or spawn if its your first time)! You can run the command again to return to the resource world spawn.

* Resets every few months
* World dimensions are **10k x 10k** blocks from spawn
* Consistent with the main world, this world generated with Terralith + Geophilic, and thereâ€™s no mob griefing or fire spread
* RTPing costs a discounted price of **15** vibecoin
* [Resource sethomes/waypoints](tweak-list/personal-waypoints.md) allow you to save waypoints in the world
* Your location in the resource world persists when you change worlds, so you can return back to the resource world and be in the same place you left off
* Nether & end is shared with the main world ones
* Claiming, setting warps and regular sethomes is disabled
* 50% reduced hostile mob spawns compared to the main world
