# Land Claiming

Claiming is an extra precaution that protects your land from griefing & theft. It ensures only those you allow can build and interact within it. While it's not necessarily required, it's most definitely recommended to protect your work!

{% hint style="info" %}
Every hour of play time, your claimable block limit will increase by **350** blocks. You can view your claim blocks in **`/claimlist`** or **`/profile`**
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
### No-grief guarantee

Per the [rules](../general/community-guidelines.md), griefing & stealing is not allowed even on unclaimed land! If you're griefed or stolen from under any circumstance you may contact [staff](../general/ranks.md#helper) on our [Discord ](../general/discord.md)or in-game to have the damage rolled back.
{% endhint %}

## Checking claim bounds

* Right click while holding a stick to highlight claims where you're looking
* Shift + right click to highlight all nearby claims

_The highlighted claim(s) will appear with gold blocks and glowstone on the corners_

## Granting / revoking permissions

* **`/trust <name>`**\
  Opens the trust menu to give someone access to your claim(s). Applies to the claim you're standing in, or if in no claim all your claims. Use "all" for the name if you wish to apply the permission to all members.\

* **`/untrust <name>`**\
  Remove someone's access to your claim(s). Applies to the claim you're standing in, or if in no claim all your claims

**There are 3 tiers of permission you can choose to grant others:**

<table><thead><tr><th width="287"> </th><th width="120">Complete access</th><th width="121">Containers &#x26; mobs</th><th width="123">Buttons, levers, etc.</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Build &#x26; break</td><td>       ✅</td><td>       ❌</td><td>       ❌</td></tr><tr><td>Access &#x26; modify container contents (ex. chests, furnaces)</td><td>       ✅</td><td>      ✅</td><td>       ❌</td></tr><tr><td>Open doors &#x26; gates</td><td>       ✅</td><td>       ❌</td><td>       ❌</td></tr><tr><td>Interact with &#x26; damage passive mobs</td><td>       ✅</td><td>       ✅</td><td>       ❌</td></tr><tr><td>Trigger buttons, levers, pressure plates, etc.</td><td>       ✅</td><td>       ❌</td><td>       ✅</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Claim Guide

### Step 1

It's important to note that claims are restricted to cuboids.To begin creating a claim, right click where you'd like one of the corners of the claim to be with a claiming shovel. If you don't have one, you can use **`/kit claim`**

### Step 2

Right click again on the opposite corner at the other side of your desired claim area

{% hint style="success" %}
**Height** doesn't matter, claims automatically expand from the bottom to the top of the world
{% endhint %}

### Step 3

If the claim meets minimum size and claim blocks requirements, it will be created and temporarily outlined in gold & glowstone. You can now use the [land claim commands](land-claiming.md#commands) to add friends to the claim or manage it. &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
You can **crouch + right-click** while holding a stick to bring up nearby claim boundaries anytime.
{% endhint %}
