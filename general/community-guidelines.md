      2. Everyone is to be treated equally without discrimination based on race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, or other personal characteristics.

      4. Respect others' requests to cease certain actions or shift the discussion topic.
         1. This rule is intended to promote respectful communication, not to enable unreasonable demands or requests that could negatively impact people and their gameplay, or go against fair play.
      5. Sending messages intended to provoke or upset others, or messages that intentionally instigate disagreements solely to bother someone is not allowed.
   2. **If someone indicates they are uncomfortable with a certain conversation or situation, it’s every participating person's job to adjust their behavior and language in a respectful manner.**
      1. This rule is intended to promote respectful and considerate communication and to accommodate genuine concerns, not to allow misuse or to enable disruption of community dialogue. It should not be used as a means to cease discussion arbitrarily.
   3. **Maintain a respectful and fair attitude when participating in competitive server activities, like party games or PvP.**
      1. Toxic behavior, badmouthing or gloating, is not allowed.
2. **Respect Privacy & Personal Information**
   1. **Do not ask for or share exceedingly personal or identifying information about yourself or others.**
      1. Exceedingly personal information includes, but is not limited to, full names, phone numbers, addresses, email addresses, or any other details that can directly identify someone.
   2. **Others privacy must always be respected. Never reveal another member’s personal details, even privately, without their explicit consent.**
   3. **It's important to protect yourself online and keep your your personal information secure. Sharing a lot of information about yourself, or sensitive details about yourself within our community and the internet in general is strongly discouraged. Stay safe!**

   2. **A significant portion of our community is under the age of 18. Please ensure your communication remains respectful and appropriate. Unless you know otherwise, assume that you're interacting with a younger audience.**
   3. **Topics or content that is inciteful, contentious, sexual or suggestive, likely offensive, dark, or potentially triggering or distressing, such as discussion of real-violence, personal traumas, etc. should not be publicly discussed.**
      1. Our aim is to maintain a respectful and inclusive environment for everyone and offer a place people can get away from the stress of the real world. References or discussions involving politics, religion, social issues, health and medicine, environmental concerns, economic policy, legal and criminal justice matters, current or past geopolitical conflicts, or other real-world disputes or controversies is not permitted.
   4. **As an English based server, public chat should be kept in English for effective moderation and understanding by all members.**

   5. **Excessive use of capital letters, repetition of the same word or letter, spamming, or any other disruptive chat behavior is not permitted.**
   6. **We have implemented several filters in our in-game chat and Discord server to prevent content that infringes on the rules. Any attempts to bypass these filters, whether by adding extra characters or using other methods, are not permitted.**
      1. Despite our best efforts to employ highly accurate and effective filters in place both in-game and on our Discord server to catch rule-breaking content, it’s important to remember that no filter is infallible, and that the ultimate responsibility lies with the individual authoring the content to ensure it aligns with our rules.
      2. Staff members have the final say on interpreting the rules applicability to content, even if content passes through filters.
   7. **Always provide accurate and truthful information when interacting with others. Lying, spreading false information, or intentionally misleading others is not permitted.**

   2. **You are allowed to promote your social media accounts, services, and other work in the #self-promo Discord channel.**
   3. **It’s important to ensure that any promotions do not result in flooding or spamming the chat.**
   4. **Other Minecraft server or community promotions are not allowed.**

6. **Accountability By Association**
   1. **All users are expected to uphold the integrity of the server by not engaging in or supporting any rule-breaking behavior, either directly or indirectly.**
   2. **If you knowingly collaborate with someone who is violating server rules, or knowingly benefit from such actions, you may be held equally accountable for the rule violation(s).**
      1. This applies to but is not limited to actions such as teaming up with a player using cheats, benefiting from stolen items/blocks/entities, concealing rule-breaking activities, etc.

### Section 2 | Gameplay

1. **Builds and Spaces**
   1. **Griefing, stealing, or otherwise modifying anyone's builds or land, even unclaimed, is not allowed unless you have explicit permission from the creator.**
      1. Everything in the resource world is fair game for everybody and is an exception to this rule. There is no claims or ownership of land in the resource world.
      2. Ownership of land is determined by sufficient modification of the area, for example, through constructing a house, farm, or other meaningful structure.
      3. Modifying land within a radius of 500 blocks from someone else's work could be considered a violation of this rule.
         1. Shared spaces like the market, vibetown, or other towns are not subject to this radius restriction. However, careful consideration should be given when deciding where to build in close proximity to others.
      4. Naturally generated structures such as villages, strongholds, ruined portals, desert or jungle temples, or witch huts are not protected by this rule unless another player clearly inhabits them.
      5. Failure to respect the guidelines clearly posted at shared locations, for example, community farms requesting replanting, etc., is considered a violation of the rule.
      6. Claims are offered as an extra precaution to protect your work. Though unclaimed work is still protected under the rules, we highly recommend claiming to eliminate the chance of being randomly griefed. You gain +350 claimable blocks (excluding Y axis) every hour. This value is generally more than enough for members, but for large scale builders we are happy to grant claim block bonuses per staff discretion.
   2. **Ownership of builds created by inactive players may be transferred to another player who requests it, either with the original player's permission or after a period of prolonged inactivity.**
      1. **If you're in our Discord we'll contact (and ping) you requesting permission to transfer your build. You can deny the transfer request and we will respect your decision. However, if we don't hear back in 3 days, we will proceed with the transfer.**
         1. **For members, the inactivity period required for a non-shop build to become eligible for transferring is 1 month minimum.**
         2. **For VIP players of any tier, the inactivity period for a non-shop build to become eligible for transferring is 2 months minimum.**
         3. **For Benefactors or retired staff, all builds are non-transferrable despite inactivity.**&#x20;
         4. **Staff reserve the right to deny transfers for special cases as they see fit.**
         5. **Once a build is transferred, ownership of the land is also transferred.**
         6. **The inactivity period needed for shops to be transferred are different than other builds. See the Community Market Standards below for details.**
   3. **Very low effort builds may be demolished by staff without prior warning.**&#x20;
   4. **Claims in shared spaces should be made mindfully. Claims may be resized by admins to be more reasonable, or removed all-together.**
   5. **Do not create claims on land you do not intend to occupy and build in/nearby.**
   6. **If you are on another player’s property, you must respect their space and abide by their requests to leave or refrain from certain actions within their space.**
      1. You need permission from the property owner before you save a personal or community waypoint that is within 500 blocks.
2. **Waypoints**
   1. **Setting community waypoints (warps) for personal purposes is not allowed. Community waypoints are specifically for public and notable locations like town spawns, shops, certain notable biomes or world generation, etc. intended to be shared with and utilized by the community. For private land like your base, personal waypoints (sethomes) should be used instead.**
   2. **Community or personal waypoints can only be set on or nearby another's private land with the landowner's explicit permission.**
      1. Any land outside of shared spaces, such as towns or the market, and without a community waypoint (warp) set by the landowner, is considered private land.
      2. Setting a community or personal waypoint at or nearby somebody's private land without permission is considered intent to steal or grief and is treated as such.
      3. Land within towns, markets, or other shared areas is not considered private.
         1. In this case, personal waypoints (sethomes) can be set closeby (but not directly at/in builds) without needing direct permission. For example, setting a personal waypoint (sethome) by your favorite market shop. However, community waypoints (warps) still cannot be set anywhere on another's non-private land without permission.&#x20;
      4. Saving or exposing the world coordinates or location of private land as a by any means, (ex. a client side waypoints mod) substitute for setting a waypoint is not allowed and is treated the same as setting an unauthorized personal/community waypoint.
      5. Entering or returning to somebody's private land at a later time (ex. after being teleported there) by any means is not allowed without their explicit permission.
   3. **Staff reserves the right to review or remove any waypoints as they see fit to uphold these rules. This may be done without prior warning or vcn refund (if its a warp).**
3. **Community Market Standards**
   1. **Personal structures such as bases/homes, mines, farms, and similar constructions should be positioned away from the market area. This ensures the market space can be solely utilized for trade and commerce.**
      1. Any personal structures should be at least 600 blocks from any part of the market to allow for future expansion.
      2. Living in the market is not allowed.
   2. **Shops built within a 25 block radius of official waypoint spawn platforms should be no larger than 8 blocks in length or width.**
      1. Larger shops should be built further away from spawns.
      2. The location of shops that exceed 25 blocks in length or width require clearance from a staff member before being constructed in the market.
         1. Generally, the larger the shop, the further away from spawn platforms it should be to be courteous of others shops' reachability.
   3. **Shop chests require a meaningful structure built around/by them that should be no smaller than 5x5 blocks in size.**
   4. **Shops should consist of more than one shop chest and sell/buy more than one item type**
      1. The auction house should be used for selling of such items.
      2. Specific cases for valuable or custom items (ex. special banner patterns) are waived from this rule. If you are unsure if your case infringes on this rule, please ask a staff member.
   5. **Players are allowed to create multiple shops, so long as they are spread out throughout the market and not built nearby each other.**
      1. Constructing any additional shop past 5 shops requires clearance from a staff member.
   6. **Shop and shop chest guidelines do not apply to shops/shop chests set up outside of the market region.**
   7. **Shops with inactive owners (1 or more months of inactivity) may be auctioned off to another player or demolished by staff to ensure the market shops stay lively.**
   8. **Very low effort shops may be demolished by staff without prior warning.**
   9. **We typically will contact you and request structures violating these rules to be demolished by you, but if it is not done in a timely manner or must be removed immediately, staff will handle the demolition and apply further sanctions if necessary.**
4. **Auction House Etiquette**
   1. **Auction listings should be fairly priced and reflect the item's rarity and quantity.**
   2. **Auctions should have value, common items in small quantities should not be listed.**
   3. **Items of similar type should be bundled into a single auction instead of individually to prevent spam. Bundled auctions can be created using /ah sell \<price> -b.**
5. **Trading & Scamming**
   1. **Scamming or deceiving other players out of items, vibecoin, or other belongings in any way is not allowed.**
   2. **All trades should be conducted honestly, with full disclosure and agreement from all parties involved.**
6. **PvP and Teaming**
   1. **PvP in the survival world is only allowed if all parties involved have given their explicit permission.**
      1. Simply having PvP toggled on is not sufficient as consent.
   2. **No teaming in the PvP arena or Party Games unless it is mutually agreed upon the whole lobby.**
7. **Environmental Responsibility**
   1. **Avoid uselessly or excessively damaging the landscape of the world, i.e. placing blocks under your feet as you travel, leaving hat-cut trees or hanging blocks, making dirt towers, etc.**
      1. If you create any temporary structures, like a one night dirt hut, placing a crafting table, or spawning a boat in the wilderness, dismantle them once you are done to keep the world clean.
      2. The resource world is fully exempt to this rule.
8. **Idling (AFKing)**
   1. **AFKing farming in moderation is okay, but should never require any form of auto clicking or auto movement.**
   2. **Cumulatively AFK farming longer than 12 hours within a 24 hour period is not allowed.**
      1. Extended AFK periods past 12 hours are only allowed if not for the purpose of farming. &#x20;
   3. **Note that the server restarts daily at 4:50 AM EST, but you will be auto-reconnected once the restart finishes.**\
