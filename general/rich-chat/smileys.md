# Smileys

We have a huge collection of unicode faces, symbols, and other icons you can use in chat, signs, and anvils called smileys to express yourself in-game! You can view the full collection by category using the **`/smileys`** command.  As of 8/23 and thanks to 1.20's increased unicode support, Smileys has been revamped with actual emoticons and now has a total of 252 unique smileys available!
