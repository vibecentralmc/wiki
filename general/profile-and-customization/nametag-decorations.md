# Nametag Decorations

Nametag decorations are another customization option available to all VIPs. Displayed next to your display name everywhere, including your nametag and in chat/server messages, these offer another fun way to personalize your profile!

There are over **50** decorations to choose from, with more added occasionally. The decoration is displayed next to the player's name in chat, tab, and on their nametag.
